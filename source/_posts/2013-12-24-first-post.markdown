I have no Idea what I'm doing
=============================

This is the truth. I have **no idea** why I'm bothering to learn this new hipster markup language known as [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).

What am I doing?
-------
Markdown, CoffeeScript, Sass, Haml, Jade, Compass, Bash, Github... The list does not actually end. Nope. Open Source software is infinite. I grasp as much of it as I can, but there will always be more.

###Open Source Software == Shiny New Toys

...Dafak did I just do? I tried to save my file in case this laptop decides to say **FUCK THIS** and take a break. It happens.
But back to this :waqckyness... thats right, I'm using VI(M?)... Why? There are many reasons

- Shiny New Toy (came out in the '70s but its new to me)
- Minimalism (me gusta)
- Ubiquity (aw yis)
- You can access it directly from a command line interface
- **You can access it directly from a command line interface!!!**
  - For my fellow n00bs, this means that any unix machine you come across will have this installed
- If you know how to use this arcane editor, you basically know how to use the force

Soo... I guess this is a blog post of sorts.

Let's generate some static files and see if I know kungfu

...hopefully I can exit this time and not literally type :wq *facepalm*
