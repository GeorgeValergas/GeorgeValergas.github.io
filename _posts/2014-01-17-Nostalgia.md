The stuff we feel nostalgic about, most of the time doesn't hold up to the hype we give it credit for.
But we have to ask ourselves **why** we've retained in in memory while other things have just been forgotten.

## Ch-ch-ch-ip and Daaale *Rescue Rangers*

> Whatever happened to **'it just works'**

Ok, so I'm clearly a 2 day old mac N00b and a N00b in general, but I took the route of:

 Basically, the wizard said:

 > Fly you fools!

 To which I respond:

 > Fuck this, I'm installing homebrew...

**To the commandline!**

As per the [Homebrew homepage](http://brew.sh)

``` ruby 
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/go/install)"
```
